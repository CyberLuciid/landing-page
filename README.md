# landing-page

This project is part of the foundations course for The Odin Project. The goal was to use HTML and CSS to create a
landing page layout based on the given design.

It was built with HTML5, CSS3, and Flexbox.

I practiced structuring a full webpage from scratch, using Flexbox for layout, breaking down the design into sections, 
writing cleaner, more descriptive commit messages, and using Git and GitHub for version control.
